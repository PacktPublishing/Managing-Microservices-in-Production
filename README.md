## About the Video Course
Need your microservices running in the cloud without impacting your customers or harming your revenue? This course will lead you through the essentials of what a Kubernetes cluster is and how it can effectively manage your microservices.

You'll learn about pods, deployments, and elastic capacity management, along with features such as auto-healing and how best to use them. Communication within a Kubernetes cluster is key; site reliability is equally as important, and many tools are available to support logging, monitoring, and alerting.

You'll start by setting up, instantiating, and securing your kubernetes cluster. Then you’ll learn about network management, including Ingress, Istio, and how to control your traffic flow. You’ll learn about cloud-native as well as cloud-agnostic tooling for monitoring, alerting, and telemetry gathering. Finally, you’ll learn about monitoring tools, setting up alerts to ensure the stability of your deployment.

By the end of this course, you’ll be empowered to handle multiple microservices, and have the skills to ensure that your own microservices are fault-tolerant, resilient, and responsive.
