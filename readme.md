# Managing Microservices in Practice

## Deploy your Microservices to the cloud using Kubernetes, in a robust and fault-tolerant fashion

If you are troubled with the performance of your applications, and tend to find services down because of the structural inefficiency of your microservices, then this is the course you need!

If you are a DevOps professional looking to automate microservices to increase scalability and functional usability, then this video will also be valuable.

Developers interested in transforming their monolithic applications into efficient microservices and implementing continuous and scalable delivery and deployment will also find this course useful.

Experience using a 'cloud provider' before would be beneficial.

### KEY FEATURES

- Create a robust Microservices infrastructure using Kubernetes, and learn how to communicate with your microservices
- Understand all of the different resources that make up ‘Kubernetes’
- Learn what CI and CD are, what the differences are and ways to implement them successfully

### APPROACH

This course offers a hands-on approach to learning how to manage your microservices on Kubernetes. We will use interesting real-world examples to explain the features and how to use them.
This includes: automatic capacity management on the pod level; deploying the principles of immutable infrastructure; and ways to get the most out of low-level tools. This knowledge will help you maximize your time so you can do more!

### WHAT WILL YOU LEARN

- Gain an understanding of all of the building blocks of a Kubernetes Cluster
- Efficiently use the everyday tools of a Kubernetes Administrator
- Communicate effectively with your microservices from every angle
- Difference between CI and CD and why you need them
- Find out what CI/CD tools work well for you
- Keep your applications and tools live and ready

### SUMMARY OF CONTENTS

- **Introduction and Setting up a test cluster** - In this section, you will prepare a local Kubernetes cluster environment to get you ready for the rest of the course.
- **Use and Deploy** - Get Familiar with the fundamentals of microservices management in Kubernetes, here you will use the core tools and get acquainted with the key concepts of a cluster.
- **Securing your Cluster** - Before getting too far down the road of deploying pods and services into the cluster, you will want to ensure you adopt a strong security posture when it comes to who can log into the cluster, who can create resources, and when to use service accounts to scope access.
- **Manage communication with your microservices** - You have the important building blocks in place, but how do you allow external requests to talk to your Microservices and route those requests to the right service? This section will teach you how to do that.
- **Continuous Integration → Continuous Deployment** - Now that you know how our Microservices will behave in your cluster, it is time to gain an understanding of how you can continually get your code tested and deployed.
- **Operationalize your Cluster** - Now that you have a good grasp on how to provision and deploy to a cluster, it’s time to take a deeper dive into tools and resources used to manage everything in production.  You will learn about monitoring tools, setting alerts, and incorporating things you’ve learned to help ensure the application you deploy is stable as well as the cluster it runs on.
